# Heart Arrhythmia Detection

## Overview
Heart arrhythmia detection is a machine learning project designed to analyze ECG signals and detect irregular heartbeats, providing insights into possible anomalies such as atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia, and more. This tool is intended to aid medical professionals in diagnosing heart conditions with increased accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- **ECG Signal Processing**: Preprocessing of raw ECG data to filter noise and extract meaningful features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of supervised learning algorithms for classification.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Capability to analyze live-streamed ECG data.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of ECG signals and detected anomalies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple UI for uploading ECG data and viewing results.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy, Pandas (Data Manipulation)
  - SciPy, Neurokit2 (Signal Processing)
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (Machine Learning)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
